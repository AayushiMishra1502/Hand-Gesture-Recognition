# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
 
Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe ,TenserFlow & OpenCV

OpenCV: real-time Computer vision and image-processing framework

MediaPipe: open-source and cross-platform framework developed by Google. It comes with some pre-trained ML solutions such as face detection, pose estimation, hand recognition, object detection, etc.

Tensorflow: open-source library for machine learning and deep learning developed by Google.

MediaPipe will be used to recognize the hand and the hand key points. MediaPipe returns a total of 21 key points for each detected hand.
These key points will be fed into a pre-trained gesture recognizer network to recognize the hand pose.
